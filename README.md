# ðŸ“Š Think Bayes â€” Bayesian Statistics Made Simple

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This repository explores Bayesian inference through Python implementations and simulations based on *Think Bayes* by Allen B. Downey.  
Each notebook demonstrates probabilistic reasoning using real-world examples.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Understand Bayesian reasoning through coding.  
- Implement posterior, likelihood, and prior concepts with Python.  
- Simulate real scenarios for probabilistic intuition.  
- Use PyMC and SciPy for Bayesian modeling.

## ðŸ“š Chapter List
1. Bayesâ€™s Theorem  
2. Computational Statistics  
3. Estimation and Inference  
4. Odds and Predictions  
5. Hypothesis Testing  
6. Simulation and MCMC  
7. Hierarchical Models  
8. Approximate Bayesian Methods  


## ðŸŒŸ Outcome
Gain an intuitive and applied grasp of Bayesian thinking â€” foundational for probabilistic machine learning and uncertainty modeling.
